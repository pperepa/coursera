For this project, you will do a bit of coding, but also a bit of exploring in your IDE (such as Cloud9) and just getting a feel for reading documentation, surveying code files, and running some unit tests. There are a few small puzzles in the code for you to solve, but overall there is not very much code to write this time. For all the details, please download this instructions PDF: It combines a bit of a reading lesson and the specific details about what you need to do.

You will also need to download this bundle of provided starter code, which you will use to work on the assignment. The instructions PDF tells you how to unpack it:

As the instructions explain, when you are finished working through the assignment, you'll end up with a "submission.zip" file that you can submit here on Coursera for autograding.

(During the course, If at any time you see a hyperlink on this page stating that the assignment needs to be "upgraded," please click it! That means the autograder has been improved somehow, and you need to update your assignment page to see the new version.)
